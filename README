DESCRIPTION
    perlbrew is a program to automate the building and installation of perl
    in the users HOME. At the moment, it installs everything to
    "~/perl5/perlbrew", and requires you to tweak your PATH by including a
    bashrc/cshrc file it provides. You then can benefit from not having to
    run 'sudo' commands to install cpan modules because those are installed
    inside your HOME too. It's a completely separate perl environment.

INSTALLATION
    To use "perlbrew", it is required to install "curl" or "wget" first.
    "perlbrew" depends on one of this two external commmands to be there in
    order to fetch files from the internet.

    The recommended way to install perlbrew is to run these statements in
    your shell:

        curl -Lk http://xrl.us/perlbrewinstall | bash

    After that, "perlbrew" installs itself to "~/perl5/perlbrew/bin", and
    you should follow the instruction on screen to setup your ".bashrc" or
    ".cshrc" to put it in your PATH.

    The downloaded perlbrew is a self-contained standalone program that
    embeds all non-core modules it uses. It should be runnable with perl 5.8
    or later versions of perl.

    This installer also installs a packed version of "patchperl" to
    "~/perl5/perlbrew/bin", which is required to build old perls.

    The directory "~/perl5/perlbrew" will contain all install perl
    executables, libraries, documentations, lib, site_libs. If you need to
    install "perlbrew", and the perls it brews, into somewhere else because,
    say, your HOME has limited quota, you can do that by setting a
    "PERLBREW_ROOT" environment variable before running the installer:

        export PERLBREW_ROOT=/opt/perlbrew
        curl -Lk http://xrl.us/perlbrewinstall | bash

    You may also install perlbrew from CPAN:

        cpan App::perlbrew

    However, please make sure not to run this with one of the perls brewed
    with perlbrew. It's the best to turn perlbrew off before you run that,
    if you're upgrading.

        perlbrew off
        cpan App::perlbrew

    You should always use system cpan (like /usr/bin/cpan) to install
    "App::perlbrew" because then it will be installed under a system PATH
    like "/usr/bin", which is not affected by perlbrew "switch" or "use"
    command.

    However, it is still recommended to let "perlbrew" install itself. It's
    easier, and it works better.

USAGE
    Please read the program usage by running

        perlbrew

    (No arguments.) To read a more detailed one:

        perlbrew -h

PROJECT DEVELOPMENT
    perlbrew project uses github
    <http://github.com/gugod/App-perlbrew/issues> and RT
    <https://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=App-perlbrew> for issue
    tracking. Issues sent to these two systems will eventually be reviewed
    and handled.
