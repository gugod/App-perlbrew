=head1 COMMANDS

=over 4

=item B<init>

Run this once to setup the C<perlbrew> directory ready for installing
perls into. Run it again if you decide to change C<PERLBREW_ROOT>.


=item B<mirror>

Run this if you want to choose a specific CPAN mirror to install the
perls from. It will display a list of mirrors for you to pick
from. Hit 'q' to cancel the selection.


=item B<install> perl-<version>

Build and install the given version of perl.

You can give a URL to a tarball of a Perl release to install that.

Versions of perl are specified as "perl-5.xx.x" for normal releases,
"perl-5.xx.x-RCx" for release candidates, and "perl-blead" or just "blead" for
the latest version from the git integration branch.

=item B<install> /path/to/perl/git/checkout/dir

Build and install from the given git checkout dir.


=item B<list>

List the installed versions of perl.


=item B<use> [perl-<version>]

Notice: this only works in bash and zsh.

Switch to the given version of perl only in the current shell. This
will not effect newly opened shells.

You can use as C<perl-version> the special keyword C<system> to stop
using any perlbrew-based perl.

Without a parameter, shows the version of perl currently in use.


=item B<switch> [perl-<version>]

Switch to the given version, and makes it the default for this and all
future terminal sessions.

Without a parameter, shows the version of perl currently selected.


=item B<off>

Disable perlbrew. Use C<switch> command to re-enable it.


=item B<env> [perl-version]

Low-level command. Use this command to see the list of environment
variables that are set by C<perlbrew> itself for shell integration.

The output is something similar to this (if your shell is bash):

    export PERLBREW_ROOT=/Users/gugod/perl5/perlbrew
    export PERLBREW_VERSION=0.13
    export PERLBREW_PATH=/Users/gugod/perl5/perlbrew/bin:/Users/gugod/perl5/perlbrew/perls/current/bin
    export PERLBREW_PERL=perl-5.12.3

You can also ask for the proper variables for a specific perl version.


=item B<symlink_executables> <perl-version>

Low-level command. Use this command to create the C<perl> executable
symbolic link to C<perl5.13.6>.

You don't need to do this unless you were using old perlbrew to
install perls. The installation layout is changed since version 0.11.

If you just upgraded perlbrew and found C<perlbrew switch> failed to work
after you switch to a development release of perl, say, perl-5.13.6, run this command:

    perlbrew symlink_executables perl-5.13.6

This essentially creates this symlink:

   ${PERLBREW_ROOT}/perls/perl-5.13.6/bin/perl
   -> ${PERLBREW_ROOT}/perls/perl-5.13.6/bin/perl5.13.6

=item B<install-cpanm>

Install the C<cpanm> standalone executable in C<$PERLBREW_ROOT/bin>.


=item B<version>

Show the version of perbrew.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-h| --help>

prints this help.

=item B<-f| --force>

Force installation of a perl.

=item B<-j>

Enable parallel make and test (if supported by the target perl)

  perlbrew install -j 5 perl-5.12.3

=item B<-n| --notest>

Skip the test suite

=item B<-q| --quiet>

Log output to a log file rather than STDOUT. This is the default. The log file is saved in F<$ROOT/build.log>

=item B<-v| --verbose>

Log output to STDOUT rather than a logfile.

=item B<--as>

Install a given perl under an alias.

    perlbrew install perl-5.6.2 --as legacy-perl

=item B<-D>, B<-U>, B<-A>

pass through switches to the perl Configure script.

    perlbrew install perl-5.10.1 -D usemymalloc -U uselargefiles

=back


=head1 CONFIGURATION

=over 4

=item PERLBREW_ROOT

By default, perlbrew builds and installs perls into
C<$ENV{HOME}/perl5/perlbrew> directory. To use a different directory,
set this environment variable in your C<bashrc> to the directory
before running perlbrew.

=back


=head1 UPGRADE NOTES

If you upgraded C<perlbrew> from version 0.16 or older, you should do
this cleanup your setup. Failure to do so might make the C<use>
command to fail.

Note the version of perl currently selected with C<perlbrew switch>.
Then turn C<perlbrew off>, and switched back again with C<perlbrew
switch previous-perl-version>.
