=head1 CONFIGURATION

=over 4

=item PERLBREW_ROOT

By default, perlbrew builds and installs perls into
C<$ENV{HOME}/perl5/perlbrew> directory. To use a different directory,
set this environment variable in your C<bashrc> to the directory
in your shell RC before sourcing perlbrew's RC.

It is possible to share one perlbrew root with multiple user account
on the same machine. Therefore people do not have to install the same
version of perl over an over. Let's say C</opt/perl5> is the directory
we want to share. All users should be able append this snippet to their
bashrc to make it effective:

    export PERLBREW_ROOT=/opt/perl5
    source ${PERLBREW_ROOT}/etc/bashrc

After doing so, everone's PATH should include C</opt/perl5/bin> and
C</opt/perl5/perls/${PERLBREW_PERL}/bin>. Each user can invoke C<perlbrew
switch> and C<perlbrew use> to independently switch to different perl
environment of their choice. However, only the user with write permission to
C<$PERLBREW_ROOT> may install CPAN modules. This is both good and bad depending
on the working convention of your team.

If you wish to install CPAN modules only for yourself, you should use the C<lib>
command to construct a personal local::lib environment. local::lib environments
are personal, and are not shared between different users. For more detail, read
C<perlbrew help lib> and the documentation of L<local::lib>.

If you want even a cooler module isolation and wish to install CPAN modules used
for just one project, you should use L<carton> for this purpose.

It is also possible to set this variable before installing perlbrew
to make perlbrew install itself under the given PERLBREW_ROOT:

    export PERLBREW_ROOT=/opt/perl5
    curl -kL http://install.perlbrew.pl | bash

After doing this, the perlbrew executable is installed as C</opt/perl5/bin/perlbrew>

=item PERLBREW_HOME

By default, perlbrew stores per-user setting to C<$ENV{HOME}/.perlbrew>
directory. To use a different directory, set this environment variable
in your shell RC before sourcing perlbrew's RC.

In some cases, say, your home directory is on NFS and shared across multiple
machines, you may wish to have several different perlbrew setting
per-machine. To do so, you can use the C<PERLBREW_HOME> environment variable to
tell perlbrew where to look for the initialization file. Here's a brief bash
snippet for the given senario.

    if [ "$(hostname)" == "machine-a" ]; then
        export PERLBREW_HOME=~/.perlbrew-a
    elif [ "$(hostname)" == "machine-b" ]; then
        export PERLBREW_HOME=~/.perlbrew-b
    fi

    source ~/perl5/perlbrew/etc/bashrc

=item PERLBREW_CONFIGURE_FLAGS

This environment variable specify the list of command like flags to pass through
to 'sh Configure'. By default it is '-de'.

=item PERLBREW_CPAN_MIRROR

The CPAN mirror url of your choice.

=back

=head1 COMMAND: INIT

Usage: perlbrew init

The C<init> command should be manually invoked whenever you (the perlbrew user)
upgrade or reinstall perlbrew.

If the upgrade is done with C<self-upgrade> command, or by running the
one-line installer manually, this command is invoked automatically.

=head1 COMMAND: INFO

Usage: perlbrew info

The `info` command dumps a page of handful information for the perlbrew
installation.

=head1 COMMAND: INSTALL

=over 4

=item B<install> [options] perl-<version>

=item B<install> [options] <version>

Build and install the given version of perl.

Version numbers usually look like "5.x.xx", or
"perl-5.xx.x-RCx" for release candidates.

The specified perl is downloaded from the offical CPAN website or from the
mirror site configured before.

To configure mirror site, invoke `mirror` command.

=item B<install> [options]  perl-stable

=item B<install> [options]  stable

A convenient way to install the most recent stable version of Perl, of those
that are available.

=item B<install> [options]  perl-blead

=item B<install> [options]  blead

A special way to install the blead version of perl, which is downloaded from
this specific URL regardless of mirror settings:

    http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/snapshot/blead.tar.gz

=item B<install>  [options] /path/to/perl/git/checkout/dir

Build and install from the given git checkout dir.


=item B<install>  [options] /path/to/perl-5.14.0.tar.gz

Build and install from the given archive file.

=item B<install>  [options] http://example.com/mirror/perl-5.12.3.tar.gz

Build and install from the given URL. Supported URL schemes are C<http://>,
C<https://>, C<ftp://> and C<file://>.

=back

Options for C<install> command:

    -f --force     Force installation
    -j $n          Parallel building and testing. ex. C<perlbrew install -j 5 perl-5.14.2>
    -n --notest    Skip testing

       --switch    Automatically switch to this Perl once successfully
                   installed, as if with `perlbrew switch <version>`

       --as        Install the given version of perl by a name.
                   ex. C<perlbrew install perl-5.6.2 --as legacy-perl>

    -D,-U,-A       Switches passed to perl Configure script.
                   ex. C<perlbrew install perl-5.10.1 -D usemymalloc -U uselargefiles>

    --sitecustomize $filename
                   Specify a file to be installed as sitecustomize.pl

By default, all installations are configured after their name like this:

    sh Configure -de -Dprefix=$PERLBREW_ROOT/perls/<name>

=head1 COMMAND: UNINSTALL

Usage: perlbrew uninstall <name>

Uninstalls the given perl installation. The name is the installation name as in
the output of `perlbrew list`

=head1 COMMAND: USE

Usage: perlbrew B<use> [perl-<version> | <version> | <name>]

Use the given version perl in current shell. This will not effect newly opened
shells.

Without a parameter, shows the version of perl currently in use.

=head1 COMMAND: SWITCH

Usage: perlbrew switch [ <name> ]

Switch to the given version, and makes it the default for this and all
future terminal sessions.

Without a parameter, shows the version of perl currently selected.

=head1 COMMAND: LIST

Usage: perlbrew list

List the installed versions of perl.

=head1 COMMAND: AVAILABLE

Usage: perlbrew available

List the recently available versions of perl on CPAN.

The list is retrieved from the web page L<http://www.cpan.org/src/README.html>,
and is not the list of *all* perl versions ever released in the past.

NOTICE: This command might be gone in the future and becomes an option of 'list' command.

=head1 COMMAND: OFF

Usage: perlbrew off

Temporarily disable perlbrew in the current shell. Effectively re-enables the
default system Perl, whatever that is.

This command works only if you add the statement of `source $PERLBREW_ROOT/etc/bashrc`
in your shell initialization (bashrc / zshrc).

=head1 COMMAND: SWITCH-OFF

Usage: perlbrew switch-off

Permananently disable perlbrew. Use C<switch> command to re-enable it. Invoke
C<use> command to enable it only in the current shell.

Re-enables the default system Perl, whatever that is.

=head1 COMMAND: ALIAS

Usage: perlbrew alias [-f] create <name> <alias>

    Create an alias for the installation named <name>.

Usage: perlbrew alias [-f] rename <old_alias> <new_alias>

    Rename the alias to a new name.

Usage: perlbrew alias delete <alias>

    Delete the given alias.

=head1 COMMAND: MIRROR

Usage: perlbrew mirror

Run this if you want to choose a specific CPAN mirror to install the
perls from. It will display a list of mirrors for you to pick
from. Hit 'q' to cancel the selection.

=head1 COMMAND: EXEC

Usage: perlbrew exec [--with perl-name[,perl-name...]] <command> <args...>

Execute command for each perl installations, one by one.

For example, run a Hello program:

    perlbrew exec perl -e 'print "Hello from $]\n"'

The output looks like this:

    perl-5.12.2
    ==========
    Hello word from perl-5.012002

    perl-5.13.10
    ==========
    Hello word from perl-5.013010

    perl-5.14.0
    ==========
    Hello word from perl-5.014000

Notice that the command is not executed in parallel.

When C<--with> arugemnt is provided, the command will be only executed with the
specified perl installations. The following command install Moose module into
perl-5.12, regardless the current perl:

    perlbrew exec --with perl-5.12 cpanm Moose

Multiple installation names can be provided:

    perlbrew exec --with perl-5.12,perl-5.12-debug,perl-5.14.2 cpanm Moo

The are splited by either spaces or commas. When spaces are used, it is required
to quote the whole specifiacion as one argument, but then commas can be used in
the installation names:

    perlbrew exec --with '5.12 5.12,debug 5.14.2@nobita @shizuka' cpanm Moo

As demonstrated above, "perl-" prefix can be omitted, and lib names can be
specified too. Lib names can appear without a perl installation name, in such
cases it is assumed to be "current perl".

At the moment, any specified names that fails to be resolved as a real
installation names are silently ignored in the output. Also, the command exit
status are not populated back.

=head1 COMMAND: ENV

Usage: perlbrew env <name>

Low-level command. Invoke this command to see the list of environment
variables that are set by C<perlbrew> itself for shell integration.

The output is something similar to this (if your shell is bash/zsh):

    export PERLBREW_ROOT=/Users/gugod/perl5/perlbrew
    export PERLBREW_VERSION=0.31
    export PERLBREW_PATH=/Users/gugod/perl5/perlbrew/bin:/Users/gugod/perl5/perlbrew/perls/current/bin
    export PERLBREW_PERL=perl-5.14.1

tcsh / csh users shall seens lines of 'setenv' statements instead of `export`.

=head1 COMMAND: SYMLINK-EXECUTABLES

Usage: perlbrew symlink-executables <name>

Low-level command. This command is used to create the C<perl> executable
symbolic link to, say, C<perl5.13.6>. This is only required for
development version of perls.

You don't need to do this unless you have been using old perlbrew to install
perls, and you find youself confused because the perl that you just installed
appears to be missing after invoking `use` or `switch`. perbrew changes its
installation layout since version 0.11, which generades symlinks to executables
in a better way.

If you just upgraded perlbrew (from 0.11 or earlier versions) and C<perlbrew
switch> failed to work after you switch to a development release of perl, say,
perl-5.13.6, run this command:

    perlbrew symlink-executables perl-5.13.6

This essentially creates this symlink:

   ${PERLBREW_ROOT}/perls/perl-5.13.6/bin/perl
   -> ${PERLBREW_ROOT}/perls/perl-5.13.6/bin/perl5.13.6

Newly installed perls, whether they are development versions or not, does not
need manually treatment with this command.

=head1 COMMAND: INSTALL-CPANM

Usage: perlbrew install-cpanm

Install the C<cpanm> standalone executable in C<$PERLBREW_ROOT/bin>.

For more rationale about the existence of this command, read
<http://www.perlbrew.pl/Perlbrew-and-Friends.html>

=head1 COMMAND: INSTALL-PATCHPERL

Usage: perlbrew install-patchperl

Install the C<patchperl> standalone executable in C<$PERLBREW_ROOT/bin>.  This
is automaticall invoked if your perlbrew installation is done with the
installer, but not with cpan.

For more rationale about the existence of this command, read
<http://www.perlbrew.pl/Perlbrew-and-Friends.html>

=head1 COMMAND: SELF-UPGRADE

Usage: perlbrew self-upgrade

This command upgrades Perlbrew to its latest version.

=head1 COMMAND: SELF-INSTALL

Usage: perlbrew self-install

NOTICE: You should not need to run this command in your daily routine.

This command install perlbrew itself to C<$PERLBREW_ROOT/bin>. It is intended
used by the perlbrew installer. However, you may manually do the following to
re-install only the C<perlbrew> executable:

    curl -kL http://get.perlbrew.pl -o perlbrew
    perl ./perlbrew self-install

It is slightly different from running the perlbrew installer because
C<patchperl> is not installed in this case.

=head1 COMMAND: VERSION

Usage: perlbrew version

Show the version of perlbrew.

=head1 COMMAND: LIB

Usage:

    perlbrew lib list
    perlbrew lib create <lib-name>
    perlbrew lib delete <lib-name>

The `lib` command is used to manipulate local::lib roots inside perl
installations. Effectively it is similar to `perl
-Mlocal::lib=/path/to/lib-name`, but a little bit more than just that.

A lib name can be a short name, containing alphanumeric, like 'awesome', or a
full name, prefixed by a perl installation name and a '@' sign, for example,
'perl-5.14.2@awesome'.

Here are some a brief examples to invoke the `lib` command:

    # Create libs by name
    perlbrew lib create nobita
    perlbrew lib create perl-5.12.3@shizuka

    perlbrew list     # See the list of use/switch targets.

    # Activate a lib in current shell.
    perlbrew use perl-5.12.3@nobita
    perlbrew use perl-5.14.2@nobita

    # Activate a lib as default.
    perlbrew switch perl-5.14.2@nobita

    # Delete the lib
    perlbrew lib delete nobita
    perlbrew lib delete perl-5.12.3@shizuka

Short lib names are local to current perl. A lib name 'nobita' can refer to
'perl-5.12.3@nobita' or 'perl-5.14.2@nobita', depending on your current perl.

When C<use>ing or C<switch>ing to a lib, always provide the long name. A simple
rule: the argument to C<use> or C<switch> command should appear in the output of
C<perlbrew list>.

=head1 COMMAND: UPGRADE-PERL

Usage: perlbrew upgrade-perl

Minor Perl releases (ex. 5.x.*) are binary compatible with one another, so this
command offers you the ability to upgrade older perlbrew environments in place.

It upgrades the currently activated perl to its latest released brothers. If you
have a shell with 5.14.0 activated, it upgrades it to 5.14.2.

=head1 COMMAND: DOWNLOAD

Usage:

    perlbrew download perl-5.14.2
    perlbrew download perl-5.16.1
    perlbrew download perl-5.17.3

Download the specified version of perl distribution tarball under C<<
$PERLBREW_ROOT/dists/ >> directory.

=head1 COMMAND: LIST-MODULES

List all installed cpan modules for the current perl.

This command can be used in conjunction with `perlbrew exec` to migrate
your module installation to different perl. The following command
re-installs all modules under perl-5.16.0:

    perlbrew list-modules | perlbrew exec --with perl-5.16.0 cpanm

=head1 UPGRADE NOTES

If you are upgrading C<perlbrew> from 0.16 or ealier versions to a recent
one (0.40-ish), you should do these steps to adjust your perl installations
afterwards (you might need to change the value of PERLBREW_ROOT):

    export PERLBREW_ROOT=${HOME}/perl5/perlbrew
    rm -f $PERLBREW_ROOT/perls/current
    rm -f `find $PERLBREW_ROOT/perls/bin -type l`
    perlbrew symlink-executables
    perlbrew init

Following the instructions on screen to tweak your shell a bit. Then it
should be good.
