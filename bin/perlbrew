=head1 COMMANDS

=over 4

=item B<init>

Run this once to setup the C<perlbrew> directory ready for installing
perls into. Run it again if you decide to change C<PERLBREW_ROOT>.


=item B<install> perl-<version-number>

=item B<install> <version-number>

Build and install the given version of perl.

Version numbers usually look like "5.x.xx", or
"perl-5.xx.x-RCx" for release candidates.

The specified perl is downloaded from the cpan webisite, unless mirror
setting are present.


=item B<install> perl-blead

=item B<install> blead

A special way to install the blead version of perl.

The blead version is downloaded from:

    http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/snapshot/blead.tar.gz

This command does not consult mirror settings.


=item B<install> /path/to/perl/git/checkout/dir

Build and install from the given git checkout dir.


=item B<install> http://example.com/mirror/perl-5.12.3.tar.gz

Build and install from the given URL.

=item B<mirror>

Run this if you want to choose a specific CPAN mirror to install the
perls from. It will display a list of mirrors for you to pick
from. Hit 'q' to cancel the selection.


=item B<list>

List the installed versions of perl.


=item B<use> [perl-<version>]

=item B<use> [<version>]

Switch to the given version of perl only in the current shell. This
will not effect newly opened shells.

You can use as C<perl-version> the special keyword C<system> to stop
using any perlbrew-based perl.

Without a parameter, shows the version of perl currently in use.


=item B<switch> [perl-<version>]

=item B<switch> [<version>]

Switch to the given version, and makes it the default for this and all
future terminal sessions.

Without a parameter, shows the version of perl currently selected.


=item B<off>

Disable perlbrew. Use C<switch> command to re-enable it.


=item B<env> [perl-version]

Low-level command. Use this command to see the list of environment
variables that are set by C<perlbrew> itself for shell integration.

The output is something similar to this (if your shell is bash):

    export PERLBREW_ROOT=/Users/gugod/perl5/perlbrew
    export PERLBREW_VERSION=0.13
    export PERLBREW_PATH=/Users/gugod/perl5/perlbrew/bin:/Users/gugod/perl5/perlbrew/perls/current/bin
    export PERLBREW_PERL=perl-5.12.3

You can also ask for the proper variables for a specific perl version.


=item B<symlink_executables> <perl-version>

Low-level command. Use this command to create the C<perl> executable
symbolic link to C<perl5.13.6>.

You don't need to do this unless you were using old perlbrew to
install perls. The installation layout is changed since version 0.11.

If you just upgraded perlbrew and found C<perlbrew switch> failed to work
after you switch to a development release of perl, say, perl-5.13.6, run this command:

    perlbrew symlink_executables perl-5.13.6

This essentially creates this symlink:

   ${PERLBREW_ROOT}/perls/perl-5.13.6/bin/perl
   -> ${PERLBREW_ROOT}/perls/perl-5.13.6/bin/perl5.13.6

=item B<install-cpanm>

Install the C<cpanm> standalone executable in C<$PERLBREW_ROOT/bin>.


=item B<version>

Show the version of perbrew.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

=over 4

=item PERLBREW_ROOT

By default, perlbrew builds and installs perls into
C<$ENV{HOME}/perl5/perlbrew> directory. To use a different directory,
set this environment variable in your C<bashrc> to the directory
before running perlbrew.

=back


=head1 UPGRADE NOTES

If you upgraded C<perlbrew> from version 0.16 or older, you should do
this cleanup your setup. Failure to do so might make the C<use>
command to fail.

Note the version of perl currently selected with C<perlbrew switch>.
Then turn C<perlbrew off>, and switched back again with C<perlbrew
switch previous-perl-version>.
