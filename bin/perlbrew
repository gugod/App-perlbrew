        install        Install perl
        uninstall      Uninstall the given installation

        list           List installed perls
        use            Use the specified perl in current shell
        off            Turn off perlbrew in current shel
        switch         Permanently use the specified perl as default
        switch-off     Permanently turn off perl

        version        Display version
        help           Read more detailed instructions

    Examples:
        perlbrew install perl-5.14.1
        perlbrew install 5.12.1

        perlbrew list

        perlbrew use perl-5.12.3
        perlbrew switch perl-5.14.1

=head1 INITIALIZATION

If you never run perlbrew before, or you do not have a C<~/.perlbrew> directory,
you should perform the initialization process by running:

    perlbrew init

This step needs to be done only once.

If latter on you need to change C<$PERLBREW_ROOT>, you (and all other users
who share the same C<$PERLBREW_ROOT> will have to run this again to make it affective.

=head1 COMMANDS

=over 4

=item B<install> [ perl-<version> | <version> ]

Build and install the given version of perl.

Version numbers usually look like "5.x.xx", or
"perl-5.xx.x-RCx" for release candidates.

The specified perl is downloaded from the CPAN website, unless mirror
setting are present.

=item B<install> [ perl-blead | blead ]

A special way to install the blead version of perl, which is downloaded from
this specific URL regardless of mirror settings:

    http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/snapshot/blead.tar.gz

=item B<install> /path/to/perl/git/checkout/dir

Build and install from the given git checkout dir.


=item B<install> /path/to/perl-5.14.0.tar.gz

Build and install from the given archive file.

=item B<install> http://example.com/mirror/perl-5.12.3.tar.gz

Build and install from the given URL. Supported URL schemes are C<http://>,
C<https://>, C<ftp://> and C<file://>.

=item B<uninstall> <target>

Uninstalls the given version.

=item B<use> [perl-<version> | <version> | <name>]

Use the given version perl in current shell. This will not effect newly opened
shells.

Without a parameter, shows the version of perl currently in use.

=item B<switch> [perl-<version> | <version> | <name>]

Switch to the given version, and makes it the default for this and all
future terminal sessions.

Without a parameter, shows the version of perl currently selected.

=item B<list>

List the installed versions of perl.

=item B<available>

List the available versions of perl on CPAN.

=item B<off>

Temporarily disable perlbrew in the current shell.

Re-enables the default system Perl, whatever that is.

=item B<switch-off>

Permananently disable perlbrew. Use C<switch> command to re-enable it.

Re-enables the default system Perl, whatever that is.

=item B<alias> [-f] create <name> <alias>

Create an alias for the installation named <name>.

=item B<alias> [-f] rename <old_alias> <new_alias>

Rename the alias to a new name.

=item B<alias> delete <alias>

Delete the given alias.

=item B<mirror>

Run this if you want to choose a specific CPAN mirror to install the
perls from. It will display a list of mirrors for you to pick
from. Hit 'q' to cancel the selection.

=item B<exec> command

Execute command for all perls.

For example, run a Hello program:

    perlbrew exec perl -e 'print "Hello from $]\n"'

The output depends on your perl installations, and looks like this:

    perl-5.12.2
    ==========
    Hello word from perl-5.012002
    
    perl-5.12.3
    ==========
    Hello word from perl-5.012003
    
    perl-5.13.10
    ==========
    Hello word from perl-5.013010
    
    perl-5.14.0
    ==========
    Hello word from perl-5.014000

Notice that the command is not executed in parallel.

=item B<env> [perl-version]

Low-level command. Use this command to see the list of environment
variables that are set by C<perlbrew> itself for shell integration.

The output is something similar to this (if your shell is bash):

    export PERLBREW_ROOT=/Users/gugod/perl5/perlbrew
    export PERLBREW_VERSION=0.28
    export PERLBREW_PATH=/Users/gugod/perl5/perlbrew/bin:/Users/gugod/perl5/perlbrew/perls/current/bin
    export PERLBREW_PERL=perl-5.14.1

You can also ask for the proper variables for a specific perl version.

=item B<symlink_executables> <perl-version>

Low-level command. This command is used to create the C<perl> executable
symbolic link to, say, C<perl5.13.6>. This is only required for
development version of perls.

You don't need to do this unless you have been using old perlbrew to
install perls. The installation layout is changed since version 0.11.

If you just upgraded perlbrew (from 0.11 or earlier versions) and C<perlbrew
switch> failed to work after you switch to a development release of perl, say,
perl-5.13.6, run this command:

    perlbrew symlink_executables perl-5.13.6

This essentially creates this symlink:

   ${PERLBREW_ROOT}/perls/perl-5.13.6/bin/perl
   -> ${PERLBREW_ROOT}/perls/perl-5.13.6/bin/perl5.13.6

Newly installed perls, whether they are development versions or not, does not
need manually treatment with this command.

=item B<install-cpanm>

Install the C<cpanm> standalone executable in C<$PERLBREW_ROOT/bin>.

For more rationale about the existence of this command, read
<http://www.perlbrew.pl/Perlbrew-and-Friends.html>

=item B<self-upgrade>

This command upgrades Perlbrew to its latest version.

=item B<version>

Show the version of perlbrew.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-h| --help>

prints this help.

=item B<-f| --force>

=item B<-j>

Enable parallel make and test (if supported by the target perl)

  perlbrew install -j 5 perl-5.12.3

=item B<-n| --notest>

Skip the test suite

=item B<-q| --quiet>

Log output to a log file rather than STDOUT. This is the default. The log file
is saved as F<$PERLBREW_ROOT/build.log>, which is, by default, F<~/perl5/perlbrew/build.log>.

=item B<-v| --verbose>

Log output to STDOUT rather than a log file.

=item B<--as>

Install a given perl under an alias.

    perlbrew install perl-5.6.2 --as legacy-perl

=item B<-D>, B<-U>, B<-A>

pass through switches to the perl Configure script.

    perlbrew install perl-5.10.1 -D usemymalloc -U uselargefiles

=back


=head1 CONFIGURATION

=over 4

=item PERLBREW_ROOT

By default, perlbrew builds and installs perls into
C<$ENV{HOME}/perl5/perlbrew> directory. To use a different directory,
set this environment variable in your C<bashrc> to the directory
before running perlbrew.

=back


=head1 UPGRADE NOTES

If you upgraded C<perlbrew> from version 0.16 or older, you should do
this cleanup your setup. Failure to do so might make the C<use>
command to fail.

Note the version of perl currently selected with C<perlbrew switch>.
Then turn C<perlbrew off>, and switched back again with C<perlbrew
switch previous-perl-version>.
